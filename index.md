### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because we got to creat functions that did calculations.
    We got to create functions, then would call them! Creating the conversion functions 
    was so useful and made for an interesting debugging session.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was also a memorable lab because we got to test our skills by creating 
    for loops with if statements in them. The combination was intresting because I 
    struggled on creating them on my own time. This lab helped improve my coding skills!

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was a challenging lab because we had to use math and had to convert
    variables. My most favorite part was using break and return withing complex loops
    with if else statments.
