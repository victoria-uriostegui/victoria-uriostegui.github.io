### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because we got to create functions that did calculation
    conversions. We got to create functions, then would call them! At frist, this used to be hard for me to understand, but this lab helped my understanding. Creating the conversion functions was so useful and made for an interesting debugging session.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2 was also a memorable lab because we got to test our skills by creating 
    for loops with if statements in them. The combination was intresting because I 
    struggled on creating them on my own time. This lab helped improve my coding skills!
    My partner and I collaborated intensly on this lab.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was a challenging lab because we had to use math and had to convert
    variables. My most favorite part was using break and return withing complex loops
    with if else statments. At first, our logic was wrong, but then fixed it and passed
    the test.
